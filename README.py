Game idea:
Dance Dance Revolution type game
Directional arrows will drop down from the top of the screen
The player must hit the corresponding arrow on their keyboard when the arrows hit a line at the bottom of the camera
There will be a score tally and health meter at the side of the screen
The closer you are to hitting the arrow right as it touches the line the more points you get
Text will flash on the screen representing how close the player was to hitting it perfectly
As you either miss, hit the wrong arrow button, or press a button too early, you will lose health
If you hit enough consecutive arrow you start to slowly regain health
Health regain increases as streak increases
As time goes on, the arrows speed up
If health drops to 0, the game ends
Displays game over and top 5 players and their scores
Gives you option to save your name and score to a high score file

Basic Features:
User Input: user inputs arrows corresponding to the ones on screen
Game Over: games ends when health drops to 0
Graphics: Arrows dropping down will be different colored graphics

Additonal Features:
Health Bar
Inter-session Progress
